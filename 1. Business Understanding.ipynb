    "# **1.0 Business Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "## __1.1 Overview__\n",
    "\n",
    "Tanzania faces a critical challenge in providing clean water to its population due to a substantial number of water wells being non-functional or in need of repair. This situation poses significant risks to public health, economic productivity, and educational opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## __1.2 Challenges__\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited Resources:** Government agencies and NGOs often have limited resources for maintaining and repairing wells.\n",
    "- **Lack of Data-Driven Prioritization:** Repair efforts may not be targeted effectively due to a lack of comprehensive data on well functionality.\n",
    "- **Suboptimal Well Design:** The causes of well failures are not well understood, leading to potentially suboptimal designs for new wells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## __1.3 Proposed Solution (Metric: Accuracy Score >= 80%)__\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict the functionality status of water wells (functional, non-functional, functional needs repair) based on available data. This model will enable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prioritization of Repairs:**  Targeted allocation of resources to the wells most in need of repair.\n",
    "- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Informed decision-making by government agencies and NGOs regarding well maintenance and construction strategies.\n",
    "- **Improved Water Access:**  Increased access to clean water for Tanzanian communities, leading to improved health and well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "## __1.4 Brief Conclusion__\n",
    "\n",
    "By harnessing the power of data and machine learning, this project aims to provide a scalable and cost-effective solution to address Tanzania's water crisis. The successful implementation of the model has the potential to transform the lives of millions of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "## __1.5 Problem Statement__\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant number of water wells in Tanzania are non-functional or require repairs, leading to a lack of access to clean water for a large portion of the population. This situation poses severe risks to public health, as well as economic and educational opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## __1.6 Objectives__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Develop a Predictive Model:** Create a machine learning model that accurately predicts the functionality status of water wells using features like pump type, installation date, and other relevant factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify Key Predictors:** Analyze the model to identify the key factors that contribute to well functionality or failure, providing insights that can inform future well design and maintenance strategies.\n",
    "\n",

    "## __1.7 Data Understanding__\n",
    "\n",
    "### __1.7.1 Source__\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this project was downloaded from DrivenData as part of the \"Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table\" competition: \n",
    "[https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### __1.7.2 Columns__\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains various features relevant to water well functionality, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`amount_tsh`:**  The total static head (amount of water available to pump) in meters.\n",
    "- **`funder`, `installer`:** The entity that funded/installed the well.\n",
    "- **`gps_height`:**  The altitude of the well in meters.\n",
    "- **`longitude`, `latitude`:** Geographic coordinates of the well.\n",
    "- **`basin`:**  The geographic water basin where the well is located.\n",
    "- **`population`:** Population around the well.\n",
    "- **`public_meeting`:** Indicates whether there was a public meeting about the well project.\n",
    "- **`scheme_management`:** The entity managing the water supply scheme.\n",
    "- **`permit`:** Indicates whether the well has a government construction permit.\n",
    "- **`construction_year`:** Year the well was constructed.\n",
    "- **`extraction_type_class`:** The kind of extraction technology used by the well.\n",
    "- **`management_group`:** How the well is managed.\n",
    "- **`payment_type`:** What the water costs.\n",
    "- **`quality_group`:** The quality of the water.\n",
    "- **`quantity`:** The quantity of water.\n",
    "- **`source_class`:** The general type of source of the water.\n",
    "- **`waterpoint_type`:**  The kind of well.\n",
    "- **`status_group` (Target):** The functionality status of the well (functional, non-functional, functional needs repair).\n"

    "In organizing this project into six distinct Jupyter notebooks (Business Understanding, Data Preparation, EDA, Modeling and Evaluation, Deployment(.py), and Conclusion & Recommendations), a strategic approach was adopted to enhance the overall workflow and project management. This modular structure serves several key purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduced Runtime Efficiency:** By isolating computationally intensive tasks like data preprocessing or model training into separate notebooks, resources can be allocated more effectively, and individual steps can be executed independently without re-running the entire analysis each time. \n",
    "- **Improved Editing and Collaboration:**  Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of the project, making it easier to locate and modify relevant code sections. This targeted approach also facilitates collaboration among team members who can work on different notebooks concurrently without interfering with each other's progress. \n",
    "- **Enhanced Reproducibility and Organization:** The clear separation of project phases into different notebooks provides a logical structure, making the analysis process more transparent and easier to reproduce. Additionally, it allows for better version control and documentation of each step.\n",
    "- **Targeted Debugging:** If errors occur, isolating them to a specific notebook simplifies the debugging process, as the scope of the issue is narrowed down.\n"
